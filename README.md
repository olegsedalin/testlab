# Test Lab - AI Algorithm Testing Pages

A collection of web pages designed for testing various AI algorithms: translators, summarizers, and other text processing tools.

## 🎯 Purpose

The project includes three main test pages:

### 1. 🇷🇺 Translation Test Page (`index.html`)

Contains specially selected Russian text with simple, unambiguous sentences without ambiguity. The text is designed so that any quality translator (human or AI) translates it consistently to other languages.

### 2. 🇺🇸 Article for Summarization (`article.html`)

Comprehensive English article "The Quantum Revolution: Transforming Cryptography in the Digital Age" - perfect for testing summarization algorithms, key point extraction, and text analysis.

### 3. 🎯 Interactive Testing Page (`interactive.html`)

Interactive page with various UI elements for testing automation, bots, and scripts. Includes scenarios from simple to medium complexity.

## 📝 Content

### Russian Test Page Includes:

- Everyday situation descriptions
- Simple object descriptions and their properties
- Basic actions and professions
- Season descriptions
- Concrete, understandable concepts without abstractions

### English Article Contains:

- **Structured content** with clear sections and subsections
- **Key concepts** of quantum computing and cryptography
- **Practical examples** and real-world applications
- **Expert quotes** and statistical data
- **Conclusions and predictions** for future technology development
- **~3000 words** optimal length for summarization testing

### Interactive Page Features:

- **Simple scenarios:** click counter, toggles, visibility, style changes
- **Medium complexity:** forms with validation, modals, drag & drop, dynamic lists, sliders, tabs
- **Interaction logging** with timestamp tracking
- **Result export** in JSON format

## 🌐 Usage

### GitHub Pages

The page is optimized for GitHub Pages:

1. **Automatic deployment:** `index.html` file automatically displays as the main page
2. **Adaptivity:** correct display on mobile devices

### Local Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
